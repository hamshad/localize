## Position

**Current Phase:** 05
**Current Plan:** Not started
**Total Plans:** 3
**Progress:** [▓▓▓▓░░░░░░] 33%

## Decisions

- CLI flags take precedence over config file for immediate overrides
- Config stored at ~/.localize/config.json for user home directory access
- Mode-based architecture for utility features (Converter/Stopwatch/Timer/Alarm)
- [Phase 02-utilities]: Mode-based architecture for utility features
- [Phase 02-utilities]: Alarms persist to ~/.localize/alarms.json
- [Phase 03-visual]: First city in each panel as reference for relative time offset
- [Phase 04-expansion]: Expanded to 37 cities across 6 categories
- [Phase 05-ui-redesign]: Fullscreen map as ricing showpiece — no panels, overlay-only features
- [Phase 05-ui-redesign]: Higher-res bitmap (480x192) + dynamic scaling to terminal size
- [Phase 05-ui-redesign]: City markers show 3-letter abbr + 12hr time on map, pulsing selection
- [Phase 05-ui-redesign]: Menu via M/Space/Enter, features in centered modal overlays
- [Phase 05-ui-redesign]: ASCII analog clock in feature overlays
- [Phase 05-ui-redesign]: Minimal 1-row status bar, [=] menu indicator, no footer/header
